@book{761822,
    abstract = {{AMPL is a language for large-scale optimization and mathematical programming problems in production, distribution, blending, scheduling, and many other applications. Combining familiar algebraic notation and a powerful interactive command environment, AMPL makes it easy to create models, use a wide variety of solvers, and examine solutions. Though flexible and convenient for rapid prototyping and development of models, AMPL also offers the speed and generality needed for repeated large-scale production runs.   This book, written by the creators of AMPL, is a complete guide for modelers at all levels of experience. It begins with a tutorial on widely used linear programming models, and presents all of AMPL's features for linear programming with extensive examples. Additional chapters cover network, nonlinear, piecewise-linear, and integer programming; database and spreadsheet interactions; and command scripts. Most chapters include exercises.   Download free versions of AMPL and several solvers from www.ampl.com for experimentation, evaluation, and education. The Web site also lists vendors of the commercial version of AMPL and numerous solvers.}},

@book{nocedal99,
    abstract = {{NUMERICAL OPTIMIZATION presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. Drawing on their experiences in teaching, research, and consulting, the authors have produced a textbook that will be of interest to students and practitioners alike. Each chapter begins with the basic concepts and builds up gradually to the best techniques currently available. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the area. Above all, the authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative and rigorous--one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side.}},
